Hey there, my name's André Sucena and I'm a 30-something Portuguese industrial engineer turned SAP consultant. I envisioned pirHANA &mdash short for projects, implementations, and reviews in S/4HANA &mdash in 2019 as a consulting business specialized in SAP logistics and logistics processes.

##Short bio

I majored in Management and Industrial Engineering back in 2013 and have worked in logistics some way or another ever since. I had the good fortune of working as a manager in Bosch, which was very focused in implementing Lean Manufacturing methodologies at the time that had a profound influence in my future work as a consultant. I used the company's mature SAP ECC system extensively as a manager, from SD/MM to APO. Eventually I got tired of opening change requests and creating frankenstein-like excel files for planning and decided to become a SAP consultant myself.

###as a consultant

I started working as a SAP consultant in ROFF Consulting and stayed there for almost 2 years, during which I've specialized in SD and MM in S/4HANA environments. During my employment there I've had the opportunity of being in several clients in different project stages and complete one full lifecycle implementation. Besides SD and MM, I've also become an expert in Transportation (LE-TRA), Settlement Management (LO-AB), and Advanced Returns Management (LO-ARM). Beginning of 2019 I was employed by Novabase, which assigned me to an Oil and Gas company as a general consultant. Here I've broadened my skills to FICO especially while working on a VIM (Vendor Invoice Management) implementation for receiving OCR'd paper invoices. 

List of chronological achievements:
* Implemented LE-TRA for outbound transportation in the paper and pulp ìndustry;
* Supported SD/MM rollout in Portugal for a food packaging company;
* Implemented Settlement Management (LO-AB) for rebates processing (both customer and vendor rebates) in an office supplies company;
* Completed one full lifecycle implementation in SD, also implementing LE-TRA for both inbound and outbound transportation, Settlement management (LO-AB), and Advanced Returns Management (LO-ARM), in an automotive spare parts company;
* Implemented the Dunning process, automatic clearing process, EDI for vendors and a Vendor Invoice Management system for receiving OCR'd vendor invoices in SAP for further processing through a dashboard tcode, in the Oil and Gas industry.

I have a programming background from college, so I have no problem specifying something to ABAP in pseudo-code or debugging issues myself.

##Bottomline

If you are searching for a young professional who has a vast know-how on the supply chain and how things can be achieved in SAP, and that will support you in implementing SAP solutions, then contact me at pirHANA and I'll be happy to help.
