    I started pirHANA -- short for "Projects, Implementantions and Reviews in S/4HANA" -- in the turn of the decade from 2019 to 2020. pirHANA aims to be an expert partner you can rely on to help in all your SAP needs, with no strings attached. We focus on delivering value in a clear way, and getting out as soon as we are not needed.
