    During my time at University of Aveiro, I learnt most of the skills that I believe eventually turned me to consulting. This is mainly because Management and Industrial Engineering has a very broad programme that ultimately encourages holistic thinking. The courses range from Calculus to Business Administration, and from Electromagnetism to Leadership in organizations. Mixed with some Accounting and Coding courses, I now believe it's a perfect degree for a SAP functional consultant.
    
    In 2011 I lived one semester in Rome for my Erasmus Programme, in University of Rome Tor Vergata, which greatly broadened my horizons after meeting people from all over the world in such an historical city. While in Aveiro, I was also involved in a "Tuna," which is a traditional Portuguese student musical group, and in organizing an International Summer School on Economics.
